           TESTIMONIALS
            <br><br>
            I've had the privilege to work with Joyce Lee in her role as Service Manager, release planner and change co-ordinator for almost 4 years at BlackBerry.  
            <br>
            Her ability to precisely gather information, motivate her team mates, and follow through on all commitments makes her a stand-out in any complex            operation.  She has the rare skill to understand enough technical detail, quickly initiate action to meet organizational needs and then identify what weaknesses in the process or system that needs to be corrected to improve the team's productivity.
            <br>
Joyce is enthusiastic and a true team player.  She continues to learn new skills and take on new challenges.  If the opportunity presents itself at any time, I wouldn't hesitate to work with her again. Joyce makes any team stronger.

            Joyce has effectively supported the change ticket process for the Smarts upgrade project over the past months. However, her persistent work over the past weeks to create, change and manage tickets to enable the final upgrade of all ACM and AM nodes was key to the successful completion of those upgrades. It is not just the quality and volume of work that Joyce took on but the positive “can do” attitude she maintained throughout . We recognize that there many other pressures and requests  being made of Joyce throughout this period. She efficiently  managed every request and change we made with accuracy and a positive attitude. She is clearly the right person to have in the job.
